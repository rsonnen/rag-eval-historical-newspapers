    description: >
      You are creating questions for historians researching American Prohibition.
      Questions should test understanding of how newspapers covered the era,
      what social attitudes were expressed, how enforcement was reported, and
      what regional perspectives existed. Focus on content that requires reading
      the actual newspaper text, not general knowledge of Prohibition history.

  document_retrieval:
    name: "Document Retrieval"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to test retrieval of specific news items,
      headlines, or details from the newspaper pages. Questions should target
      specific events, names, dates, or quotes that appear in the documents.
      Account for OCR errors - the question/answer should match what's actually
      in the extracted text, which may contain recognition errors.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are testing whether a retrieval system actually read these newspaper
      pages. Questions must have specific, verifiable answers from the text -
      particular names, dates, locations, or quoted phrases. Be aware of OCR
      quality issues; test for content that's clearly readable despite any
      recognition errors.
